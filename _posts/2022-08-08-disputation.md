After a lot of work, I finally had my disputation to defend my thesis. As usual, your coworkers create a funny hat for yourself. So my hat was theming Hercules as he defends the young students against the nine-headed Hydra. In this analogy, I am Hercules and the Hydra are common things like the pre-lectures, the bureaucracy, and my favorite programming language Python. 

After defending the thesis, there is a tradition in Jena to throw a wreath over the sword of the Hanfried statue on the market place. I needed several attempts, but at the end I succeeded by hitting the sword handle.
