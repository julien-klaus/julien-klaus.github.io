I am very please, that my latest publication ['Convexity Certificates from Hessians' ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10430) was accepted at the NeurIPS conference 2022. If you are familiar with optimization, then you know, that if your function is convex, a solution to the optimization problems becomes a global solution. So it is great to know if your optimization function is convex. The publication determines this property by examining the Hessian (2nd derivative) of the function. If this Hessian is positive semidefinite, then the function is convex. 

The NeurIPS conference took place in New Orleans and I could not withstand the opportunity to take a ride into the swamps. I saw a lot of alligators, snakes and of course raccoons.
