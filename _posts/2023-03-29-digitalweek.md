Through my time at Rotaract a knew a lot of law students. One of those students now organized an event called digital week, to give law students a better understanding of digital topics. On such topic was programming, and he asked me if I could give a short introduction to programming and more specific app development. 

It was no problem to think about some interesting application we can develop together. Since law students have many things to remember, we developed a learning app. Where there can save notes and during the learning, random notes are presented. Since all students never saw programming code, I tried to make it as accessible as possible, using the MIT AppInventor. There you have a Scratch like language with an enormous power (as long as you only want to create simple apps). 

I think at the end everybody got a nice working application and did learn the basic programming principles, like branches, loops and so on. Hopefully, those students are no longer afraid of the term algorithm.
