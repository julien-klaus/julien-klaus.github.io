Through the past computer science summer camps, I've been working a lot with MIT App Inventor. Even though the Scratch-like language is very intuitive, there are some difficulties I keep running into. For example, function returns are only possible with an extra `do-return` block or passing a lot of information between screens with a dictionary. Also, more complicated algorithms require a good amount of creativity to build them with basic operations.

I was able to present all these learned things at an MIT App Inventor workshop in May 2023. This workshop was organized by the _Stiftung für Technologie, Innovation und Forschung Thüringen (STIFT)_ and I was allowed to present the MIT App Inventor to many people in a short workshop. Since the people are mostly teachers and want to teach the learned things to students, I decided to implement a small game. It was a simple reaction game and the most complicated block stores the highscores of each player. We didn't get everything done in the two hours, but everyone ended up with a runnable program and a lot of fun.
