I am very pleased that to present my first publication, _Vectorizing Mathematical Expressions_ at the KPS 2017 in Weimar. By vectorizing, I mean the transformation from formulas in an index notation (using sum symbols) into a notation using just linear algebra. As there are so many specialized packages implementing linear algebra operations, e.g. BLAS, this transformation results in a speed-up of some orders of magnitude. 

A simple example could be the matrix vector product of a matrix $A$ with a vector $b$, computing $c=Ab$. In Python using for-loops this can be computed as
````
for i in range(A.shape[0]):
  for j in range(A.shape[1]):
    c[i] += A[i][j] * b[j]
`````
But it would be much faster to use a library implementing the `dot` function like `numpy`. There, this matrix vector product is written as
````
c = A.dot(b)
````
Although this example is quite easy, many problems are given in a notation addressing the elements of vectors and matrices using indices. There, this transformation is not straightforward and needs some knowledge about linear algebra. 

Next to the conference, I was also wandering around Weimar. Visiting Schillers residential building and the Duchess Anna Amalia Library. Weimar is a city full of history and wonders.
