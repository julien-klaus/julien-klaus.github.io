I am very pleased that to present my first publication, _Vectorizing Mathematical Expressions_ at the KPS 2017 in Weimar. By vectorizing, I mean the transformation from formulas in an index notation (using sum symbols) into a notation using just linear algebra. As there are so many specialized packages implementing linear algebra operations, e.g. BLAS, this transformation results in a speed-up of some orders of magnitude. 

A simple example could be the matrix vector product of a matrix $A$ with a vector $b$, computing the elements $c_i=\sum_j^m A_{ij}\cdot b_j$ for all $i\in\{1,\dots,n\}$. In Python using for-loops this can be computed as
````
for i in range(A.shape[0]):
  for j in range(A.shape[1]):
    c[i] += A[i][j] * b[j]
`````
But it would be much faster to use a library implementing the `dot` function like `numpy`. There, this matrix vector product is written as
````
c = A.dot(b)
````
Although this example is quite simple, it illustrates the problem. Calculations are often given in the above notation using sum signs. However, the application of the linear algebra libraries requires the calculation in a notation of linear algebra. In the publication we describe this transformation.

Next to the conference, I was also wandering around Weimar. Visiting Schillers residential building and the Duchess Anna Amalia Library. Weimar is a city full of history and wonders.
