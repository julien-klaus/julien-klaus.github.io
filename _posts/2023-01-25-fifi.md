Some years have passed since I joined the [Friends of the Institute of Computer Science](https://www.fifi.uni-jena.de/) in 2020 and was directly elected chairman in my first general meeting. Now, after three years, I was again elected as chairman. During the last three years, especially student initiatives have been supported more and more. My goal in the next three years will be to make the Friends of Computer Science more known in the faculty and hopefully win many more members. This would be beneficial to support even more initiatives, and hopefully also young scientist see the advantage of the association.
