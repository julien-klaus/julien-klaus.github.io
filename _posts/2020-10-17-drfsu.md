I was elected first in 2019 and now in 2020 to the DR.FSU the doctoral student representation of the University of Jena. I am delighted about the trust.

As I was elected straight into the board in 2019 during my first candidacy, the first year was very exhausting and I had to learn a lot. Now in 2020 I have been re-elected to the board, and I am looking forward to start in a more productive way. 

It is always exciting to organize events, and the DR.FSU definitely gives me enough opportunities to do so.
