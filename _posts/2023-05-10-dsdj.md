When I first helped out as an assistant at the Data Science Day in Jena in 2017, I never dreamed that I would be the main organizer of this event starting in 2019.

Since I never really learned how to organize events, I just decided to do a lot of things based on my instincts. And so far, I've actually only ever received positive feedback. In addition to organizing the day's talks, my tasks naturally also include raising funds and planning the catering. 

Being the main organizer of course also has its advantages, allowing me to realize ideas that I think will work. For example, since 2019 we have mugs in the respective color of the Data Science Day. These mugs have become extremely popular and become a rare collectible. This year, for the first time ever, I wanted to try a poster session, and I was surprised by how many posters were actually submitted. As a result, 23 posters were presented on the day itself and so far the feedback has been nothing but positive as well. 

Even though 2023 might have been my last Data Science Day as an organizer, I will certainly come back later as a visitor or maybe even a speaker.
